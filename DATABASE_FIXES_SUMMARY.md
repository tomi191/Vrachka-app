## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Backup First! (Critical)

```bash
# Via Supabase CLI
supabase db dump -f backup_before_014.sql

# Or via pg_dump
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_before_014.sql
```

### 2️⃣ Apply Migration

**Option A: Supabase Dashboard** (Recommended)
1. Go to SQL Editor
2. Paste `014_fix_database_issues.sql`
3. Click Run

**Option B: CLI**
```bash
cd Vrachka-app
supabase db push
```

### 3️⃣ Verify Success

```sql
-- Should see success message
-- "Migration 014_fix_database_issues completed successfully!"

-- Quick test
SELECT * FROM run_all_cleanup_jobs();
```

---

## 🧪 Before Migration - Pre-Check

Run these queries to check for potential conflicts:

```sql
-- Check for duplicate referral redemptions
SELECT referred_user_id, COUNT(*)
FROM referral_redemptions
GROUP BY referred_user_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
-- Expected: 0 rows (if rows exist, see README for fix)

-- Check for orphaned ai_usage_logs
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM ai_usage_logs
WHERE user_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM profiles)
AND user_id IS NOT NULL;
-- Expected: 0 (if > 0, see README for fix)

-- Check if is_admin() function exists
SELECT is_admin();
-- Expected: TRUE or FALSE (not error)
```

## 📈 Database Health Check

### Before Migration
```
✅ Schema Design:        8.5/10
⚠️ RLS Security:         8.0/10  (1 recursion issue)
⚠️ Indexes:              8.0/10  (missing 15 indexes)
⚠️ Constraints:          7.0/10  (missing 4 constraints)
⚠️ Foreign Keys:         7.5/10  (1 inconsistent FK)
⚠️ Data Retention:       6.0/10  (no cleanup strategy)

OVERALL: 7.7/10 ⚠️
```

## 🔧 Maintenance Recommendations

### Daily Cleanup (Automated via Cron)

```sql
-- Add to Supabase Dashboard > Database > Cron Jobs
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'vrachka-daily-cleanup',
  '0 2 * * *',  -- 2 AM UTC daily
  $$ SELECT run_all_cleanup_jobs(); $$
);
```

### Weekly Monitoring

```sql
-- Check disk usage
SELECT
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS size
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC;

-- Check cleanup effectiveness
SELECT * FROM run_all_cleanup_jobs();
```

### Monthly Review

- Review financial snapshots for accuracy
- Check for slow queries in Supabase logs
- Verify RLS policies are working correctly
- Review user feedback for performance issues

---

## 🚨 Rollback Plan

If critical issues occur, rollback instructions are in:
- `README_014_MIGRATION.md` - Full rollback SQL

**⚠️ Note:** Rollback will lose performance improvements and revert to vulnerable state.

---

## 📞 Need Help?

If you encounter issues:

1. Check `README_014_MIGRATION.md` for detailed troubleshooting
2. Review Supabase logs in Dashboard > Logs
3. Test with pre-check queries above
4. Consider rollback if critical production impact
