## 🧪 Post-Migration Testing

Run this in SQL Editor to test:

```sql
-- Test cleanup function
SELECT * FROM run_all_cleanup_jobs();

-- Test utility function
SELECT * FROM get_user_feature_limits(
  (SELECT id FROM profiles LIMIT 1)
);
```

Should return results without errors ✅

## 🗓️ Next Steps (Optional)

### Set up automatic cleanup (Recommended)

```sql
-- Run daily at 2 AM UTC

);
```

This will automatically clean old data based on user plan:
